BuildDefence is a side project game where you as a player must defend your base with dwindling resources, maybe actually make it a top down instead of side view? A spaced based factorio similar concept, starting on earth but as you gain a larger and larger factory/society both exponential population growth but also running out of uranium and coal
to power machinary, wind and tidal still work but solar doesn't unless you setup a smog clearing system/make your factory and society more green. Upon creating space travel, using electrolysis produce hydrogen and oxygen and then send rocket to the moon, in the rocket you perhaps have to play an asteroid type game and also a gof2 mining based minigame
to find the best place to land for a helium-3 mine. Here you can collect helium-3 which takes a while to fill the rocket and there is risk when flying back the rocket so you may not wish to fill it up all the way but reduces the amount of hydrogen you need for multiple launches and also you may need a small amount of helium more quickly (economy of
scale also perhaps the rocket is not reusable until later so Metal input). Jetpack joyride type ride home with solar flares and the like structural integrity or perhaps gta based losing helium-3 under damage?~ helium-3 has a large supply on the moon and will slowly replenish due to solar wind. Time limit asteroid which contains lots of a particular
material, perhaps upon retrieving allows to create interspatial portals.

Make the components of the game modular, efficient and easily expandable

Use GLFW (Graphics Library Framework) to create an application window to draw in and to handle keyboard, mouse and joystick input.
